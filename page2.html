      Like so many of England's racing circuits, Silverstone started life as an aerodrome. 
      When the Second World War ended in 1945, England's other two circuits, Donington Park and the legendary Brooklands, had fallen into disrepair. 
      And so it was that the outer taxiways and interconnecting runways of Silverstone became adopted by the Royal Automobile Club 
      as the home for the British Grand Prix in 1948. The circuit was fast and challenging and in 1949 the shape was formed that remains the basis 
      of the track to this day.
