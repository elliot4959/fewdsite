### Designs and Ideas
The first place I went for design inspiration for my Formula 1 website was the official [Formula 1 website](https://www.formula1.com/). From here I got the idea of a large slideshow taking centre stage of my index page.

Looking further down the page I also implemented the smaller news stories, I went back and forth on the separation I would use for this content, but ultimately decided that at the largest size I would spread them out evenly over the screen. (More information to follow about how this was achieved technically).

I also used the offical website to help me see how I might design my other pages, as I am not a particularly artistic or visionary designer. I am very pleased with this finished product, however, and am glad I was able to credit the place most of my design ideas began.
